In the repository 'MCTruth_and_kinematics' the code analyzes the file VBFHHTo2b2T_27March2018.root in order to study the 
kinematics of the process. The output of the program is a way to study hoe the HJ and Hjj categories behave.

In the repository 'significance_maximization' the codes analize the files TT_fullyLep.root, TT_semiLep.root and 
VBFHHTo2b2T_27March2018.root. 'performance.cpp' draws the plots of the significanze with the data coming from the .txt files.

In the repository 'analysis' the code analizes the file VBFHHTo2b2T_27March2018.root in order to fill simultaneously the HJ,
Hjj, SJ and Sjj categories. It then compares them and gives us the efficiencies of the study.
